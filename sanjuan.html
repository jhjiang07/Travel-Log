    <p> I went to <span class="location1">San Juan, Puerto Rico </span> in December of 2019. My family and family friends went on a Carriean cruise together, and one of the stops was San Juan! </p>
    <div class="decoration"> <p> <b> Why I love San Juan </b> </p> 
       <ol> 
         <li> Developing area (less reliant on technology). A new kind of city I am not used to.</li>
        <li> The houses are beautiful! They are colorful </li> 
        <li> The culture there is different </li>
        <li> Amazing sight seeing areas, like their trees, ocean and nature. </li>
