    <p> Next stop: <span class="location2"> Washington D.C.!</span> I went here July of 2019 to compete in a STEM Competition called TSA. Outside of the competition, my teammates and I went sightseeing all over Washington D.C. because it homes so many historical and national monuments that are valued in the United States! I am happy I got to see so many famous and historical places. Here was my agenda for the different places we went sight seeing:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th> Date </th>
          <th> First Location </th>
          <th> Second Location </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> June 30 </td>
          <td> National Harbor </td>
          <td> National Art Museum </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> July 1 </td>
            <td> Arlington National Cementery </td> 
            <td> The White House </td>
          </tr>
          <tr> 
            <td> July 2 </td>
            <td> Thomas Jefferson Memorial </td>
            <td> United States Capitol </td>
        </table>
    <p> During the trip , I also filmed and edited a little video log. I captured many moments during this trip. Here is the vlog I made when I was at Washington D.C. Feel free to watch it! It features many of the places I went sight seeing at, and a bit from the competition that took place in D.C.  </p>
