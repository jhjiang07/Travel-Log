    <p> The last trip I will be talking about is when my family and I went to <span class="location1"> Yellowstone </span> back in the summer of 2018. I loved Yellowstone because it featured so many geographical rareties, like the geysers or the beautiful acidic pool! Yellowstone is a gift in nature!

    <p> This is one of the acidic pools at Yellowstone. I think they are cool because they have a pretty blue color, and they let off steam! This was the prettiest thing in Yellowstone for me. 
    <p> Here is a travel guide from National Park Service. It features the cool things you can see in Yellowstone! </p>
